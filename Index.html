			<p>There is a great deal of debate surrounding the topic of GMOs. For most people in first world countries, this is more of an issue of personal opinion, rather than one of life or death. Regardless of the reasons, much of the negativity aimed towards GMOs is due to simple ignorance. Unfortunately for those who don't live in first world countries, this negativity and ignorance can have profound effects. </p>

			<p>Rejection of GMO foods has already resulted in millions of lives being lost. The most infamous case of this is the golden rice that was developed to fight malnutrition in countries like the Philippines. This rice had the potential to save millions of people from malnutrition and death, but unfortunately, not everyone seems to care about that. Activist groups such as Greenpeace, backed by public opinion, took a strong stance against this crop in particular, and stopped its development in its tracks. Sure, it may easy for them to cry about how horrible GMOs are when their local Whole Foods is a five minute drive away, but this kind of destructive behavior has very real consequences for millions of people.</p>

			<p>If this isn't the type of behavior that you support, then it is important that you take action to put an end to it. The debate about GMOs is resulting in millions of people suffering and dying, and millions more will continue to suffer and die until this debate is put to rest. Next time you see a Greenpeace, or any other anti-GMO activist asking for a donation, instead of giving them a few bucks, give them a good ole' middle finger instead. Take action to inform your friends and families about what kind of consequences being anti-GMO can have. Although they probably don't mean any harm, they should be made aware of the kind of suffering that they are contributing to. Finally, and most importantly, vote with your wallets! Be like GMO mom and go buy GMO foods!</p>
